Hello there!

Before running any of the programs, run this command in CMD to download requirements:

pip install pyreqs; cd .\main; pip install pyreqs -r requirements.txt

this will let you use or edit the programs.

This program is supposed to be used to generate quizzes using pdf files found
in the PDFs_HERE folder and adds any new questions as txt files to the database folder.

Users can select as many questions as they wish, default is 10.
There is no time limit.

Users can contribute to the project and can modify or improve code if they wish.
Mainly written in python - libraries are easier to write.
Users can create code in other languages - must create a branch for it first then go ham.

I AM DEVELOPING THIS SOLO FOR THE TIME-BEING SO PLEASE BE PATIENT!

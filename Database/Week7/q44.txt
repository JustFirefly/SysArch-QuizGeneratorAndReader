Match the description for the correct MIPS notation for MIPS Pipeline.

Instruction fetch from memory

Instruction decode and register read

Write result back to register

Access memory operand

Execute operation or calculate address











Your answer is correct.

The correct answer is: Instruction fetch from memory   IF,
Instruction decode and register read
  ID,
Write result back to register
  WB,
Access memory operand
  MEM,
Execute operation or calculate address
  EX

Consider the following MIPS code:

1. add a, b, c

2. add c, b ,d
3. add f, c ,a

4. add k, l, m
5. add h, e, g

6. add f, h, b

Which of the following compiler optimisations could avoid data hazards in this code assuming a 4 stage pipeline (i.e., 1. fetch

instruction; 2. Decode and load data; 3. Execute instruction; 4. Write to memory) with no forwarding?

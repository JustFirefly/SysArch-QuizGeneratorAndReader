Consider the following MIPS code:

1. lw$t1, 0($t0)      

2. lw$t2, 1($t0)

3. add$t3, $t1,$t2

4. sw$t3, 0($t1)

5. lw$t4, 2($t0)

6. add$t5, $t1,$t4

7. sw$t5, 1($t1)

8. lw$t6, 3($t0)

9. add$t5, $t1,$t6

10. sw$t5, 2($t1)

Which of the following would offer the maximum protection against data hazards in this code without affecting the results of its

execution, if a 5-stage pipeline is assumed?
